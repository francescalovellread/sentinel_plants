# Note on code for Fig S15
The files 'runSpread_SI_1.m' and 'runSampling_SI_1.m' are functions for performing spread and sampling simulations in an SI model, where random individuals are selected for sampling.
The files 'runSpread_SI_1_REPEATED.m' and 'runSampling_SI_1_REPEATED.m' are functions for performing spread and sampling simulations in an SI model, where the same individuals are selected for sampling each time.
The file 'random_vs_repeated_sampling.m' uses these functions to create Fig S15.
