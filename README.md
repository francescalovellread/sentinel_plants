# sentinel_plants
Code for reproducing the results presented in 'Using "sentinel" plants to improve early detection of invasive plant pathogens' (F.A. Lovell-Read, S.R. Parnell, N.J. Cunniffe, R.N. Thompson).

All code written in MATLAB, compatible with version R2022a.

Note: code for Figs 3C, 4BCD, 5ABC, 6, S1-14 and S18 is available in two versions - 'local' and 'ARC'. Code in 'local' folders will run directly through the MATLAB UI. Code in 'ARC' folders is written for use on the University of Oxford Advanced Research Computing (ARC) facility (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22558) which we used to produce the figures in this paper.
