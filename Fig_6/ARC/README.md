# Note on code for Fig 6 (ARC)
The file 'Fig_6_RUN.m' is the main code that performs the calculations.
The files 'runSpread_1.m', 'runSampling_1.m', 'runSpread_2.m', 'runSampling_2.m', 'objFunc.m' and 'objConstraint.m' are functions called within that code.
The file 'submissionScript.sh' is the script used to run the code on the ARC facility.
The file 'Fig_6_PLOT.m' is used to plot the results using the output data.
